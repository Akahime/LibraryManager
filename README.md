# Overview

This project is about developing a Library Management System (LMS). We have to implement with OOP a fully-operational library, where 3 kinds of items are stored: books, CDs and DVDs. The used of this LMS would be a Library employee trying to update what happens in his library : arrival of a new item, member changing fidelity status, item borrowed, new room to the library…

This provides to the user a user-friendly interface in order to enable him to make easily operations on the library; for instance create new items, borrow them, add a new member, have the list of the items in a room of the library…
This user-friendly interface was created with two different tools :

* The first one is the CLUI : Command-Line User Interface. This interface is located in the package LMS and is implemented in the class Launcher. With this CLUI, the user interacts with a console which guides him through the creation and the management of a library.
* The second one is a GUI : Graphic User Interface. This interface is located in the package GUI and is implemented in the class GraphicalInterface. This GUI is like any executable you could download on the internet, it is a basic window. As the user make complicated modifications to the library, new windows pop open where he has to select or fill in some data.
